## Quantifying XAI's Heatmaps
This project folder contains all the codes related to the paper [**Quantifying Explainability of Saliency Methods in Deep Neural Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02899). Supp. material is here (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360439499_xaibasiccyb_supppdf)

**Objective**: to provide a more objective way to evaluate heatmaps generated by eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. A nice [tutorial by pytorch Captum](https://captum.ai/tutorials/Resnet_TorchVision_Interpret) demonstrates how they can be applied and show the heatmaps . 

The project introduces 2 main things:
* A **10-class synthetic cells** dataset. The dataset consists of images of 10 different types of cells (one of them is blank) placed in 3 different types of background. They are synthetic, and thus can be generated on demand. See fig. 1
* A metric defined to quantify heatmaps' values. We define the *five-band score* and makes use of a stratification process to accompany it. Depending on the context, different scores may be needed, but we hope eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) will grow with a good spirit of objectivity, by developing good methods of quantification similar to the way introduced in the above-mentioned paper.

As of now, only python is supported. Deep learning/deep neural network models have only been implemented using pytorch. Contact me at ericotjoa@gmail.com if you are interested to set up different implementations.

Be sure to check out the tutorial folder to see how to use or display the dataset.

The main results in the paper are produced using 
```
python main.py --mode workflow --mode2 workflow1
python main.py --mode workflow --mode2 workflow2
python main.py --mode workflow --mode2 workflow3
```
Use python main.py to explore any other commands.
