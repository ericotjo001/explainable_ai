v0.4.4
+ first arxiv release. Include basic tutorials.


v0.4.3
+ fix overriding of ROC AUC values (clamp version overridden the save file of the normal version)
+ fix eval metric FP !!!
+ cut down many excessive logging info

v0.4.2
+ Get ROC AUC over the thresholds

v0.4.1
+ fixed capital letters. Somehow did not seem to matter in windows, but mattered in linux
+ added workflow4

v0.4
+ rearrange save directories
+ Fix issue 1. To pipeline/objgen/cellsX classes, unique_entries_check() has been added. Now only {0, localization, feature} will appear as entries to groundtruth heatmaps.
+ fix clamping issues for groundtruths. Groundtruths now have separate setting to prevent wrong assignment of fiveband numbers.

v0.3.4
+ Fixed TP in fiveband metric calculation.
+ make printing workflow more readable, implement timer for XAI.
+ clamping for XAI.
- Issue 1. Data got problem! Heatmaps' values are NOT only {0, localization, feature} as intended.
 For example, there are localization + feature values.

v0.3.3
+ Fix issue 1. Training both vgg (lite) and alexnet with larger batch size and smaller learning rate is enough to drastically improve the accuracy performance.
+ Allow resizing of images to 224x224, which is the size used in the original alexnet and vgg training.

v0.3.2
+ Fix Issue 1. Just a careless mistake in the code
+ To address issue 2, we try with longer training epochs in 'continuous' mode. 
- Issue 1. Even with longer training epochs, performance for both Alexnet and VGG are still bad

v0.3.1
+ fix issue 1. evaluation_xai_implementation, GuidedGradCam arg 2 with net.select_first_layer() and edit models accordingly.
+ fix issue 2. previously wrong backbone (alexnet) used. Changed to vgg16.
- Issue 1. "[S2] Early stopping limit reached without achieving target." still gives large .info file (10GB) for alexnet and vgg
- Issue 2. Performance for both Alexnet and VGG are bad

v0.3
+ .info is saved with evaluator.preloaded_val_dataset is set to None (pipeline.training.X_ten_classes) where X is resnet34 or alexnet. Saving lots of memory, solves problem 1 in v0.2.2.
+ XAI Gallery (pipeline.eval.evaluation_xai_implementation) saved with resizing option to save more memory
+ vgg is included.
+ fixed captum import issues (some methods were not imported).
- Issue 1. workflow2 'AlexNet' object has no attribute 'conv1' when calling GuidedGradCam
- Issue 2. workflow3 'AlexNet' object has no attribute 'conv1'. It is supposed to be VGG!

v0.2.2
+ Included alexnet. 
+ Generalized some function calls from resnetm so that they are usable for alexnet and others to come.
- Issue 1: .info file becomes too large (10GB).

v0.2.1
General format of training, validation, evaluation is set for resnet34.

v0.2 
setup basic training, validation and evaluation with some pytorch captum methods.

v0.1 and before
Data generator for 10-classes cells are implemented.
