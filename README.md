## EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
This repository includes the codes for different projects on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) by the main author. 

### xaia
This project provides two bottom-up construction of interpretable universal approximations. <br>
The paper can be found in the arxiv [Two Instances of Interpretable Neural Network for Universal Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15026)<br>

Fig. left A1-3,B1-3 show perfect accuracy for function approximations of Triangular Neural Network. Fig. right shows predictions based on interpolations of neighbouring values. 

### gax
This project attempts to improve predictive probability through the Augmentative Explanation process using existing heatmaps methods e.g. GradCAM and DeepLIFT.<br>
The paper is can be found in the [Augmentative eXplanation and the Distributional Gap of Confidence Optimization Score](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.00009)<br>

### srd
Simple reinforcement learning model with extreme interpretability: each neuron is purposefully designed to include semantically understandable concept.<br>
The paper can be found in the [Self Reward Design with Fine-grained Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15034) <br>

Fig. shows trajectories taken by SRD-trained 2D robots.

### xai_basic
This project provides synthetic dataset to measure the 'accuracy of heatmaps'.<br>
The paper is [**Quantifying Explainability of Saliency Methods in Deep Neural Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02899). <br>

Fig. shows the synthetic dataset.

### fcalc
This project is for [**Generalization on the Enhancement of Layerwise Relevance Interpretability of Deep Neural Network**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02516). The project has been discontinued.
